reply: 1) NO reposts. Offenders will be banned. Repeated offenders will be permabanned. If you intend on posting something, make sure that it has not already been posted here. We recommend that you don't post things you found off of other places, nine times out of ten it will have originated here and thus be considered a repost, we want OC only. It doesn't matter if it's a "different fry", if it's unoriginal, then it's a repost.

reply: [It's raw!](https://i.imgur.com/7Mq5iiX.gifv) \n \n 7A) Memes that can be considered lightly/lazily fried may be removed. You shouldn't just add a few filters of noise. This is /r/DeepFriedMemes, not r/sauteedmemes. We shouldn't have to say this since it's so obvious but completely raw memes are not allowed either. \n \n **Please message us in [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDeepFriedMemes) with your attempt at refrying BEFORE you repost it** \n \n Unsure why your meme is considered underfried / lazily fried? Check [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFriedMemes/comments/8ido71/psa_what_is_frying_and_what_is_not/) to understand why

reply: 9) The üÖ± emoji spam is not allowed anymore, if your post was removed, one of those may be the reason: \n - If your comment is more than 20% üÖ± it will be removed by a bot \n - If the punchline of your post is just üÖ± it will be removed \n - üÖ± is not allowed in the title of your post \n - No substituting other emojis for üÖ±

reply: 10) Edgy memes are not allowed and will be removed. There are very obvious lines that shouldn't be crossed. This includes (but is not limited to) jokes about pedophilia/child exploitation, rape, incest, terrorist attacks, school shootings, sexual assault, bombings, and overly racist/sexist/homophobic jokes. Don't make memes out of tragic events on the day it happens, have some respect. Violations of this rule will result in lengthy or permanent bans.

Message the mods to ask why your post was removed if you have a post removed as a shitpost.
